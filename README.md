Decoupling &amp; Glover-McFarlane robust loop-shaping for multivariable coupled systems (e.g. the 4-tank process).

Implemented in MATLAB for a control course at KTH.

# Description

The purpose is to investigate diﬀerent procedures for multivarible control design. First, we investigate static and
dynamic decoupling. The control performance is evaluated. Then, the design is robustiﬁed using a method proposed by Glover and McFarlane.

In this project the four-tank process is investigated.

Both static and dynamic decoupling are available, and are combined with decentralized PI control.

Glover-McFarlane robust loop-shaping is also used, and all scenarios include both for the minimum phase and non-minimum phase case.
